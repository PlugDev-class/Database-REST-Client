Code    |   Explanation
===========================================
-4080   |   No network card found in Service ISecurityManager (= or SecurityManagerImplementation)



Code    |   Possible solution
===========================================
-4080   |   Without any network connectivity the program isn't able to get the device-identifier (mac-address)
            Maybe your network card isn't enabled or the virtual machine (either java or os) cannot get any information
            about this component. In every case you should try to restart the program with admin access.
            This error is associated with the device, not the program <3
